# RenPy IDE
 A full IDE for Ren'Py based on Visual Basic.NET and other external libraries.

 ### What is this?

This is a small tool to help people create Ren'Py games without knowing the code, with useful tools to edit images and image positions in the game your making, instead of guessing where things will go. This project is still early on in development so any help will be appreciated, even if it's just issues I need to fix.
