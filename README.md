# RenPy-IDE

**A user-friendly IDE to help you create Ren’Py visual novels, built with Visual Basic .NET.**

---

## What is RenPy-IDE?

RenPy-IDE is a graphical program that helps you make games using [Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org/), a popular engine for visual novels and interactive stories, without having to write code by hand. With helpful visual tools for editing images, positioning them on the screen, and organizing your game scenes, RenPy-IDE aims to make game creation accessible to everyone—even if you have never programmed before!

This project is still under active development. Feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Features

- **Bird's Eye View:** Get an organised list of your project to easily edit your story scripts and images.
- **Image Tools:** Import and manipulate images for your backgrounds, characters, and UI.
